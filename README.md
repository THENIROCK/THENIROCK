- 👋 Hi, I’m @THENIROCK
- 👀 I’m interested in how to leverage artificial intelligence to make our learning more efficient!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lagrangian mechanics which is physics, I know. Currently not learning anything programming-wise :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-powered self-learning tools (I really want to teach myself string theory!).
- 📫 You can reach me at korintajima@gmail.com
